## **Cosmic Security Report**

## **Introduction**

Hello, my name is **Cosmic**, and I am a **Bug Hunter**. Bug hunting involves identifying and reporting vulnerabilities in systems, applications, or networks to improve cybersecurity. Many companies and organizations run **Bug Bounty programs**, which reward researchers for discovering and responsibly disclosing security flaws. However, this report **is not part of a paid program**â€”the vulnerabilities described here are disclosed responsibly for awareness and remediation.

**Important:** This report is publicly available, meaning security analysts, ethical hackers (_white hats_), and even malicious actors (_black hats_) may access this information. Immediate action is strongly advised (for real).

## **Risk Rating System**

| Level (0-10)       | Severity                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **10 - Critical**  | Exploitation can cause severe damage (e.g., data breaches, full system compromise). |
| **7-9 - High**     | Significant vulnerability but may require specific conditions to exploit.           |
| **4-6 - Medium**   | Moderate impact, often exploitable in combination with other flaws.                 |
| **1-3 - Low**      | Minimal risk, usually related to suboptimal configurations.                         |
| **0 - Negligible** | No direct security impact, but improvements are possible.                           |

### **General Best Practices**

- **Strong Passwords:** Use complex combinations (minimum 12 characters, with letters, numbers, and symbols).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA):**
    - **2FA (Two-Factor):** Requires a second authentication method (e.g., SMS, Google Authenticator).
    - **MFA (Multi-Factor):** May include biometrics, hardware tokens, or additional layers beyond 2FA.
- **Regular Updates:** Keep systems, plugins, and dependencies up to date.
- **Automated Protection:**
    - Antivirus (for endpoints)
    - Firewall (to filter malicious traffic)
    - IDS/IPS (intrusion detection/prevention systems)
