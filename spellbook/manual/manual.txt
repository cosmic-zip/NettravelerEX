NAME
    nettraveler - A versatile toolkit for cybersecurity.

SYNOPSIS
    nettraveler [MODULE_NAME] [OPTION]... [FILE]... [IP]...

DESCRIPTION
    nettraveler is a cyberdeck toolkit built for runners who dive deep into the
    NET. It's your all-in-one rig for data-ghosting, ICE-breaking, and
    corp-system infiltration. Whether you're running forensic traces, scraping
    OSINT feeds, or slicing through firewalls, nettraveler's got your back.

EXAMPLES
    nettraveler map.local
        Map all open local connections.

    nettraveler scna.socialnet --expression user_name
        Search for the user_name keyword across over 1200 sites.

    nettraveler map.default --target example.com
        Perform a default port scan on the specified target.

INSTALLATION
    The project initially includes a set of default files. These files are
    created using the best possible data analysis techniques, and their final
    versions are merged into the main project.

    go to releases and download the latest; unzip de the file and and find
    and run ./nettraveler.lua

    Additionally, it will
    prompt you to run the commands for downloading the archive files for OSINT and
    wordlists. You can choose to download one, both, or neither, but keep in mind
    that the archives are required for ip lookup operations.


    The data package provide:

        * unique wordlists
        * default credentials database
        * ip geolocation
        * ip reputation/score
        * a set of social media pages for evil twin attacks
        * general wordlists for directories and subdomains
        * mac address vendor database
        * lists for: usernames, nicks, env keywords, geoloc,
        * xss wordlist

        The data package has now been fully compressed and is 590MB in size. To download it,
        please check the README page for the updated link. If you are using the complete
        distribution package, you do not need to perform this step.
        
        To install the complete data package, simply download and copy it to: /var/data package
        
EVILPAGES
    Put your cloned pages in data/evilpages/{name}/index.html
    You can use the SingleFile extension or a similar tool to clone webpages:
    https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/
        
    nettraveler server.eviltwin --address 127.0.0.1:9000 --path foo/bar/index.html
        
RCFILE
    To record logs of all your interactions in a smartlog that can be used for data analisys and
    automatic report generation, just run:
        
    nettraveler record
        
        
FLAGS SCLF
    Standard Command-Line Flags (SCLF): All commands managed by the nettraveler engine
    use standardized flags. If you plan to add new commands to the data package
    (bindsdb.json), please follow this convention.
        
PLUGINS
    nettraveler is extensible through static files and lua code. Additionally,
    you can extend its functionality by using the bindsdb.json file. This file
    contains a list of small shell scripts, allowing you to integrate any
    terminal-based operations using arguments with the parser
        
    Example:
        Custom command in the terminal:
            mycommand --flag value --key value --some foo
        
        The corresponding entry in db.json:
            {
                "name": "mycommand",
                "description": "My command does something cool",
                "command": "mycommand --flag @@flag --key @@some_name_for_the_key"
            }
        
        Final nettraveler command:
            mycommand --flag foo --some_name_for_the_key value
        
        Here:
            - Values are 'foo' and 'bar'.
            - CLI arguments are '--flag' and '--some_name_for_the_key'.
        
    You can assign any name to a flag. Note that flags are not positional.
    Repeating a flag will not create a list of values. If a flag is repeated,
    only the first occurrence will be accepted. This design covers 98% of CLI
    interactions. Edge cases are not supported.
